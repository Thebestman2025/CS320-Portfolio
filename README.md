## Reflection Questions

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality, I write comprehensive unit tests to validate each module. For security, I follow best practices like input validation and encrypt sensitive data.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I use user stories and project requirements to guide development. For example, in Project One, I implemented a contact service to meet specific user needs for storing and managing contacts.

### How do I approach designing software?
My design process includes planning, creating diagrams, and building small, testable components. I prioritize writing clean, modular code that can be easily updated.
